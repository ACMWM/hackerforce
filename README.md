## Environment Setup

### Setup the VM after installing Virtualbox and Vagrant

```sh
# install vm via vagrantfile
git clone https://github.com/umass-cs-326/326_progenv.git && cd 326_progenv
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
# start in local /vagrant folder by default
echo "cd /vagrant" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Installing Python 3.6 with Pyenv and installing Pyenv
```sh
# Anaconda comes with python3.6, so using the latest Anaconda distro will also work in place of pyenv

# MacOS
brew install pyenv

# Linux
git clone https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

# install python3.6
pyenv install 3.6.6

# install pipenv
pip install --user pipenv
```

### Installing dependencies
``` sh
pip install django-heroku django-jinja django-bootstrap4 django-tabler django-widget-tweaks phonenumbers django-phonenumber-field faker
```

### Installing the project

``` sh
cd /vagrant
git clone https://github.com/326-queue/project.git && cd project
pipenv install
pipenv shell
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

## Creating new models (or changing existing models)
Make sure you run the following commands if you do any of the following:
* Edit a model (ie. change the database schema)
    * This includes **any** changes you make including: adding a field, removing a field, and renaming a field
* Delete a model
* Add a model

``` sh
rm -f db.sqlite3 # optional, if you need to run this you've
                 # made breaking changes to the database schema
python manage.py makemigrations # optional add the name of your
                                # app as an additional arg
                                # for example: python manage.py makemigrations profiles
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

**It should be obvious but one of the above commands deletes the developement database! Only run it in a dev environment and remember that any objects you've created for development purposes will be deleted!**

## Deployment to Heroku
Install heroku-cli if you don't have it
```
# linux
curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.sh | sh

# mac
brew install heroku/brew/heroku
```

Deploy
```sh
heroku create
git push heroku master

heroku run python manage.py migrate
```
