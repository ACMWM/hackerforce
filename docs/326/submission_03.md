# Submission 3 Documentation

## Overview of project

`Project` is a tool created to help hackathon organizers manage their sponsorship leads and keep track of contacts, emails and more. Every year hackathon organizers need to contact hundreds of contacts who work at hundreds of companies to request sponsorship. The process for this usually involves various rounds of customized emails to various groupings of companies. This tool aims to create a user friendly interface to see the status of various companies, store the details of certain contacts and overall manage the information required for hackathon sponsorship.

Many aspects of the application are similar to the CRM tool known as SalesForce and the project idea can be simply summed up as a subset of SalesForce features that is open-source and extensible for use by hackathon organizers or anyone else who desires an open-source, free CRM tool.

## Design Overview

We implemented forms for all of our major tables, including contacts, companies, emails, hackathons and sponsorships. These should allow us to both create and edit entries to these tables natively from our website. There are currently some pages that require user accounts. The user login, and signup page are fully functional allowing a first time user to create an account and sign in allowing for access to certain pages on the website.

## Problems/Successes

We did not encounter many problems during this submission. Much of the work required in this third submission was completed before the second submission. Our biggest problem was trying to catch up on particular parts of the project given a teammate's lack of contributions. Other than this however our core group was able to get our forms and login working nicely.

## Team Choice

Our functionality goals are full deployment to heroku. We would also like to create a filter bar that functions in a pseudo-SQL language allowing users to filter through our different table views even if they are unfamiliar with SQL. We also want complete email functionality allowing us to send emails through the application itself. This is a lot to accomplish, so we will most likely pick and choose from these goals what we can actually hope to have completed for the final project entry. However what we don't finish we hope to keep working on in the future so that this application can actually be used.
