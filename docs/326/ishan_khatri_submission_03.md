## User Authentication
Implemented the entire user model. It's an overload of the Django class user and provides registration, log-in, and log-out functionality. Additionally user-groups are supported and can be created/assigned from the Django admin panel.

## Misc stuff
I updated the dashboard view to reflect real stats from the sponsorship objects and fixed misc things in other folks branches during PR merges ðŸ˜Ž

## Video
I made the video again :)
