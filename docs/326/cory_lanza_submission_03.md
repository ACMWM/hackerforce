## Create Company form
I created a form that enables users to add new companies from the company page. This form has fields for each attribute of the company data model, and when submitted adds the new company to the list of companies shown on the companies page.
## Edit Company form
Created a view and form that enables users to edit companies. This has all the same fields from the create form and auto populates with the current data.
## User Authentication
Added a check to ensure that only logged in users can create or edit from the companies page. If not logged in the buttons for create and edit will not appear and the forms will not show.
