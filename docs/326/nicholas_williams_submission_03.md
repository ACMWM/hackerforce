## Hackathon Models

I created models for Hackathons, Tiers, Perks and Sponsorships

I added population of these 4 models to the init.py script

I added these models to the admin interface

## Forms

I created new and edit forms for the above 4 models, in addition to urls and views.

## Additional Show Pages and URL routing

I added a page to show the list of sponsorships for a given hackathon.

I added a page that show all hackathons and provides links to create new tiers, perks and hackathons.

I made the buttons we had on the dashboard page link to the new pages for sponsorships and hackathons.

## Carryover from Part 2

Creating a basic form template for easy creation of forms with the django forms api.

New and Edit forms for contacts model.
