## Email Model
I created an Email model that contains all relevant information for a new email. It has a subject, body, time created, time scheduled for, and a message status field which will be used to separate the table views into Drafts, Outbox, and Sent screens. 

## Email Form
I made a form that accepts input from a user to make an email, it is located at the generic emails url. It has the fields subject, body, and time scheduled to allow user creation.

## Multiple Email Displays
I made multiple email display view for the different email statuses. These include Drafts, Outbox, and Sent. They each will now have their own table view to be populated with random data.
