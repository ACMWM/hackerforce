## Email Form Edit View
I had the create form for the email page done for the last submission, so I had to get the edit form for emails up and running. This included making the view, stitching together the urls, and making the edit button work on the three email subsidiary pages.

## Multiple Email Subsidiary Tables
I created functionality that would place the created or edited email in the associated email subsidiary, be it the sent folder, drafts folder, or outbox. This included making a custom display for the sent email views, because they needed to be read only. The outbox and the drafts folder both can be edited, and if the associated folder is changed for the email, the new folder will render so that the emails new location can be seen.


## Team Right Up
I wrote the team write up, checking what everyone did, and bringing all our ideas together.
